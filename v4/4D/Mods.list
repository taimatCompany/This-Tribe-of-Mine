I'm very sad I don't have what I need to get it done.Thank you all for your compliments and for enjoying this creation of mine. I hope someone is able to breathe new life into it.https://github.com/taimatCompany/This-Tribe-of-Mine[h1]THIS TRIBE OF MINE II[/h1][h3]Version 4C.0[/h3][i]See "Change Notes" tab for details[/i]This is a DLC-Level mod. A complete overhaul to almost every item in inventory and crafting systems aimed at primitive technologies and old remedies. You will need to relearn how you approach survival both in short and long term. Many resources are now renewable.New tech tree, crafting system, and resources using primitive technologies. Traps(Mud Ovens) now serve as gathering locations. Knives and Axes are easier to make but are also used as ingredients in some recipes. [code]This mod has some late game issues. Running storyteller on linux is like trying to de-tusk an angry elephant. I would update this if I could but at the moment it just won't be possible without using windows. Which is a damn shame.[/code][h3]FEATURES[/h3]- New meals to cook such as pancakes, hashbrowns, salads, and oatmeal.- Semi-realistic recipes for Oil, Vinegar, Engine parts (vehicles to come), Aid Vouchers, Sulfur, Potting Soil, Gunpowder, Twine, Hardware, Rubber, Salt, Charcoal, and much more.- Completely rebalanced loot tables and item values- Completely rebalanced trading items- New trader dialogs- Guns can be disassembled and cleaned or assembled into different guns.- Modified crafting stations- Find animal carcasses while scavenging- Craftable metal coins used as currency- New crops- Cash in Aid Vouchers at the new, craftable Office for packages of canned food, clean water, cigarettes, or medications.- Clean your kitchen to gather materials for composting- Build your way up to constructing a vehicle for your growing colony and send it out on delivery tasks such as gathering wood from nearby forests or delivering manufactured arms to other colonies.- Make contact with outsiders to arrange for packaged deliveries.- Donate canned food to the local occupying forces in exchange for aid vouchers.[h3]NEW ECONOMY[/h3]- The economy is this version of the game has been painstaking detailed. The effort required to make an item determines its availability in the community, and its usefulness helps determine the overall market demand, which plays into the pricing. Coins also exist as a currency, and not all vendors sell all items.[h1]NEW SCENARIO - "Winter is Coming"[/h1]- A 1000 day scenario where temperatures eventually fall to Frostpunk levels. Start with one dweller, but the city is lively and many more can eventually join.- During the summer, resources are plentiful. Wood, scrap, and fabric can be readily scavenged from nearby buildings. Hardware can be extracted from salvaged wood.[h3]The world is ending. How long can you last?[/h3]Many years have passed since the establishment of the American Empire. Canada was the first to succumb to the offer, followed quickly by Mexico, South America, and Europe.After the events of the Ukraine War, The Russian Federation was seized by the Empire, and its republics broken apart into individual semi-sovereign states. But control of the motherland is not as easy as the West had imagined. The continent is vast, the peoples rugged, and infrastructure is constantly collapsing.Kazan City is bustling with activity despite the occupation. Despite the war, the residents remain mostly hopeful. The economy of the west has boomed with rampant, unchecked capitalism. Despite large corporations' benevolent promises and the popularity of "solarpunk" utopian fantasies, pollution continues to increase at an exponential rate.Since the American Emperor took control, poverty has all but vanished within a decade. Production and wealth across the globe soars, but the health of the climate has taken a turn for the worst.For a time, the climate was reaching intense temperatures. Summers around the equator became so hot they were all but unsurvivable. And then the gulf stream snapped. The effects thus far have been troubling to those paying attention, and relieving to those who are not.The unbearably hot summers have vanished in place of winters that stay later, come earlier, and seem to get colder every year. The planet feels strangely still as species have begun to disappear. Birds have stopped migrating. Even the bugs seem not to return even when the temperatures return to the ever-increasingly brief summers.Your journey beings on July first. It's warm this year. Warmer than it's been for a while. Some people are saying that our climate troubles look like they're over. Maybe they are.Or maybe it's the very last summer the world will ever see.The Tribe must survive.|enabled|workshop
