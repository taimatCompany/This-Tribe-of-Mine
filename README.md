# This-Tribe-of-Mine

I guess I can't expect anyone to really clean up my mess here, but I can at least give you all the tools to try and fix this on your own. Maybe someday I'll get a windows machine or maybe the developers might try and fix their modding tool.

I've included my obsidian vault in this repository so that you guys can feel free to explore my notes and maybe even find a use for it yourselves.

Pending changes are located in the obsidian folder under "dat/items/Updated"

Release notes for Version 4D (though i didn't have a chance to actually complete it) are located under "lib/changes/Version 4/Update D"

Special thanks of course to toomanynights who is an absolute beast of a modder. Well done in all regards, kind sir. I'd love for you to adopt my poor, broken little mod if you're so inclined. Sadly, I can play This War of Mine on my current rig but I can't mod it. Go figure.

Thanks everyone, and if you have any questions at all feel free to email me at pt071586@gmail.com.
