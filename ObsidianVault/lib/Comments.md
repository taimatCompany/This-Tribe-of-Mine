wow I didn't think this would get so much attention. I hesitate to dive back in because of the work needed for the language files. Really pissed me off last time and I rage quit. Almost 1000 subscribers and I suppose the base game probably isn't going to change anytime soon. Maybe it's time to take another swing at this.

@Art - The kindling recipe is hidden until it's needed. It will appear at the woodshop or mudoven if you have lumber, and it will appear at the sawhorse if you have a sawblade or hatchet. Keep in mind it will *cost* the tool to build, but you can always make more of that tool.

@Sunny - yeah, heating the house for winter I think was a major problem i was working on. Literally wrote I GIVE UP in my worknotes right around the time I was fixing that. The devs were not kind to modders when it comes to the language file issues. I mean, they built a great tool but a hot rod with missing a rear axle is just a drag.

@Gexi - it's not a bug it's a feature :) Because the interface gets really crowded, there's some select recipes that don't appear unless you have certain materials. I was pretty meticulous about that, and it was fairly necessary to keep things tidy.
