- Cloth harvesting speed increased
- Fixed localization strings not appearing after mod upload: In my localizations folder there was english.lang, 46fdsae674_english.lang, and ToM_2_english.lang. I sorted by date last modified to find that ToM2_english.lang was the most recently updated with the intention of swapping it for the english file; however, once i deleted the OTHER file with all the "46fdsae674" in it, (and ran a test), the damn thing started working again. Don't know why.

IF the problem returns, I will attempt to delete "english.lang" and then renamed "ToM2_english.lang" to "english.lang" and then test the upload process. I have a feeling it will rear its ugly head again. But we'll see.
