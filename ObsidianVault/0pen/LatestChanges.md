Answers

Thank you so much for playing and for your compliments! Your play through has definitely inspired me to at least try and push out a hotfix before moving on. I'm using some of the inspiration I gained from this project to build a completely new video game that I'm very excited about.

Here are some answers to some of the questions people have had:

- The research bench was the unmarked furniture item at the woodshop. It exists but because of the language file complications the text refused to render.
- Tires are in fact useful in late game when you can build a quad bike to run deliveries.
- Books are required to show several important recipes.
- In winter, scrap metal will disappear. This is to indicate all the freely available metal has been gathered. The furnace was intended to add both a recipe to smelt metal as well as heat the house (but my heater didn't work).
- The Simple Heater was in the middle of being upgraded. I had to do an funny swap of a couple workshop entities to do what i wanted, but it backfired a bit and killed my heater's functionality.
- The Arc Welder is a chokepoint technology required to build the machine shop.
- Letters are used by a workshop called "Headquarters", which for some reason was not showing up. It's a n upgrade to the office.
- Trader is supposed to come quite a bit more frequently but I've had trouble trying to figure out the math that the developer built it off of.
- I hadn't expected you to find all those vouchers... I may have made a mistake in stashing so many at the military outpost. But it's somewhat believable isn't it?
- I'm really stoked you put so much time into this. It's fairly heartbreaking to see you run into the parts that are broken.
- I'm mad that the garden was broken that should have been a very fun path. It's likely a quick fix, actually.
- The mod was definitely designed to get the player continuously falling into deeper and deeper rabbit holes, clawing your way slowly up the tech tree.
- I'm considering rebuilding this mod fresh. I've kept very meticulous track of every single item, descriptions, recipes, and text. Perhaps a fresh start and a "This Tribe of Mine III" is in order. But first, I'll probably attempt a hot fix of sorts.
- What the hell is that black box. Soap apparently? I think i can fix that.
- I definitely learned a lot with this version of the mod, and moving forward to a third rendition of it I think I'd really be able to plow through to the end.
- "Hardware" is recovered from lumber because your characters are prying it out of salvaged lumber (nails, screws, hinges, etc.)
- Last of all I really do apologize for you having to deal with a half-completed project. I had originally made this mod jsut for my own entertainment and hadn't expected so many people to take interest in it. It's both flattering and saddening due its current state.
