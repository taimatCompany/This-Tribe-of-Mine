# Job Management

Anything that needs to be created or fixed should be able to be broken 

- **Assignment:** Simple critical jobs sorted by priority=location=age. Done by choosing location with largest amount of assignments. 

- **Bill:** A specific goal generated by a project that can be broken down into assignments.

- **Case:** A case is a problem that cannot be easily solved. Cases should be broken down into the following problem statement. Assignments are created as tests and should be labeled with the Case name or numbered if in a busy environment.

- **Debts:** (High Effort, Low Impact)
